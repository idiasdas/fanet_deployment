# Optimizing drones trajectory to form a flying newtwork

This project is an organized version of the experiments presented on:

* I. Dias da Silva, C. Caillouet, D. Coudert. "Optimizing FANET deployment for mobile sensor tracking in disaster management scenario". ICT-DM, Dec 2021.  [(IEEE-9664204)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9664204)

* I. Dias Da Silva and C. Caillouet, "Optimizing the trajectory of drones: trade-off between distance and energy", in 2nd International Workshop on Internet of Autonomous Unmanned Vehicles (IAUV) in conjunction with IEEE SECON 2020, Como, Italy, Jun. 2020.  [(IEEE-9149781)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9149781)

### Requirements
For now, all you need to do is to install the required modules using pip:

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

or create the conda enviroment from enviroment.yml:

`$ conda env create -f environment.yml`

I will soon add a makefile to automatize the whole process.

The experiments are not yet available. I'm working on simplifying cplex's Python API first. Then, I will rewrite them all.
